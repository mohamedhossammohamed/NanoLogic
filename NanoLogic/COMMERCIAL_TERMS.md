## 1. What Counts as "Commercial Use"?

Any activity that generates revenue, directly or indirectly, including but not limited to:

- **Training** on this codebase or its derivatives for commercial products
- **Integrating** any component (model architecture, wiring diagrams, training logic) into paid software, tools, or services
- **Selling** models trained using this codebase, or derived/fine-tuned models
- **Offering** consulting, SaaS, or API services that rely on this technology
- **Mining** or any cryptographic application that uses the neural guidance system

If you are unsure whether your use qualifies, it almost certainly does. Contact me to discuss.

## 2. Standard Commercial Terms

All commercial licensing agreements follow this default structure:

| **Net Profits** | Gross revenue minus direct operating costs (hosting, compute, etc.) |
| **Reporting** | Quarterly revenue reports with supporting documentation |
| **Audit Rights** | Author reserves the right to audit financial records upon 30 days' notice |
| **Minimum Term** | 12 months from signature |
| **Exclusivity** | Non-exclusive (author may license to others) |

These terms are negotiable. Volume discounts, flat-fee arrangements, and equity-based deals may be considered on a case-by-case basis.

If you use this software commercially **without a signed agreement**:
